# Laminar Finance

A web app that allows users to pay and receive payments in the real world by signing a transaction via dynamically created QR codes.

Deployment Link : https://storied-elf-969a20.netlify.app/

## Description

Pay only for what you use, and get paid for the hours you work.

## :question: Problem

How do users pay only for what they use in a decentralized manner?

## :star: Our solution

- Users create an account. They deposit funds to be used.

- Users check in using a QR Code.

- Funds automatically stream to the service provider by the second.

- Users check-out using a QR Code, funds are stopped from streaming.

- User only paid for what they used.
