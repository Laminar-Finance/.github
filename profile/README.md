# Laminar Finance 

A web app that allows users to pay and receive payments in the real world by signing a transaction via dynamically created QR codes.

## Description

Pay only for what you use, and get paid for the hours you work.

## :question: Problem

How do users pay only for what they use in a decentralized manner?

## :star: Our solution

- Users create an account. They deposit funds to be used.

- Users check in using a QR Code.

- Funds automatically stream to the service provider by the second.

- Users check-out using a QR Code, funds are stopped from streaming.

- User only paid for what they used.

## :pencil: TODOs

### Pre-development

- [ ] Research more on sponsor prizes if we can submit our project for more categories (@dominicacodes)

- [x] Setup Frontend Repo
- [x] Setup Backend Repo
- [ ] Setup Vercel
- [ ] Setup Heroku (if required)
- [ ] Purchase Domain
- [ ] Work out how walletconnect works

- [ ] Superfluid Research (lewingtonpitsos)
    - [ ] Install Superfluid SDK
        - [ ] Install nvm (Node Version Manager, used for managing which node.js and npm version is in use): https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
        - [ ] Install npm using nvm (Node Package Manger, used for installing node.js packages): https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro
        - [ ] Install Yarn with npm: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable
        - [ ] Install Foundary: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry # some tools for developing with ethereum
        - [ ] Download the main superfluid repo and initialize it locally using Yarn: 
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo
        cd ./protocol-monorepo/examples/continous-auction-hardhat
        yarn install
        npm install @openzeppelin/contracts # louka had to do this to prevent import errors
        yarn add graphql -W # this was done to prevent an error
        yarn build
        yarn test
        ```
        
        650 test should pass
    - [x] Checkout Superfluid Examples on their monorepo (see the hardhat ones) (lewingtonpitsos)
        For example, to run the tests just for the budget nft example with hardhat, first make sure you have hardhat installed, then:
        ```
        cd examples/budget-nft-hardhat
        npm install # install the local dependencies for this example project
        cd test # since some relative imports will fail otherwise
        npx hardhat test
        ```
