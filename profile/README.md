# Laminar Finance 
Hackmoney 2022

Integration of Superfluid onto the Golem Network. Golem Network is a decentralized cloud compute service. It is currently lacking a streaming payment method such that users can accurately pay for what they use. This is where Superfluid comes in.

## :bulb: Ideas

- ~~Time-based insurance premiums with Superfluid~~
- ~~Time-based advertisement space rental with Superfluid~~
- ~~Time & space usage based payment for decentralized file storage with Superfluid and Filecoin~~
- ~~Time-based general payment system with Superfluid~~
